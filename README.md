# GCSTranscribe.py

## What is this for?
This script will allow you to make use of Google Cloud Speech-To-Text in order to transcribe interviews.

## Is it 100% accurate?
Silly question! Of course, there will be multiple mistakes, but even a "pre-transcript" could save you tons of time (say, you might be able to transcribe an interview within a day as compared to multiple days).

## Is it free?

### Short answer
Yes.

### Long answer
Google gives every new Google Cloud user 300USD worth of credit to try their platform. Plus, the 1st hour of interview transcriptions is free, every month. 1 hour of interview transcriptions costs 2.16USD in the worst case scenario.

With 300USD gifted by Google to spare, it is highly unlikely that you will run into any limits when using this software.
